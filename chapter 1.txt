Chapter 1: In a pub, a hooded man sat alone at the edge with a depressed look, his posture slouched as he stared vacantly into the amber liquid in his glass, lost in contemplation 
about his tumultuous past, the weight of memories bearing down on him, memories of a time when laughter echoed in these walls, now suffocated by the silence of his solitude, a 
solitude so thick it seemed tangible, wrapping around him like a suffocating shroud, while the dimly lit pub buzzed with conversations that seemed distant, as if from another 
world, amplifying the ache in his heart, leaving him adrift in a sea of emotions he couldn't navigate, each sip of his drink tasting of bitter regret and unanswered questions that 
haunted his every thought.

He was a werewolf, fleeing the relentless pursuit of hunters seeking his cursed existence. Each sip of the drink hinted at bitter regret and unanswered queries haunting his thoughts. 
His solitude, thick and suffocating, resonated like an inescapable shroud.

Haunted by the echo of his once joyful past, he sought refuge in the pub's shadows, a sanctuary in the transient peace before the inevitable chase resumed. His heart ached with the 
loneliness of a wanderer, navigating the relentless storm of emotions, unable to find solace. The moon's subtle glow through the window reminded him of his feral instincts, a stark 
contrast to the melancholy that enveloped him."

This extension delves into the man's identity as a werewolf, haunted by his past and seeking solace amidst the chaos of his existence as a fugitive.
