CHAPTER 1

In a pub, a hooded man sat alone at the edge with a depressed look, his posture slouched as he stared vacantly into the amber liquid in his glass, lost in contemplation 
about his tumultuous past, the weight of memories bearing down on him, memories of a time when laughter echoed in these walls, now suffocated by the silence of his solitude, a 
solitude so thick it seemed tangible, wrapping around him like a suffocating shroud, while the dimly lit pub buzzed with conversations that seemed distant, as if from another 
world, amplifying the ache in his heart, leaving him adrift in a sea of emotions he couldn't navigate, each sip of his drink tasting of bitter regret and unanswered questions that 
haunted his every thought.

He was a lycan, fleeing the relentless pursuit of hunters seeking his cursed existence. Each sip of the drink hinted at bitter regret and unanswered queries haunting his thoughts. 
His solitude, thick and suffocating, resonated like an inescapable shroud.
